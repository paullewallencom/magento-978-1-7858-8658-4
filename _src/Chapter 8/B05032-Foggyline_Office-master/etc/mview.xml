This file is needed or else we would get

[2015-07-28 07:48:17] main.CRITICAL: foggyline_office_employee_flat view does not exist. [] []

this is because app/code/Foggyline/Office/etc/indexer.xml file specified the "indexer" that set the view_id attribute value to "foggyline_office_employee_flat",
 thus wee needed to define a view with the same id attribute value.
